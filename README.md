Vietnamese lunch case-opening parody. 36 meals, budget and vegetarian filters, original CS:GO sound assets, Google Maps search for the chosen meal. No payments or backend records.

## Timing reference

The archived CS:GO Panorama client exposes a 2.3 s case-model lead-in plus 0.1 s scroll preparation, a 6 s scroll, cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1), 38 decorative tiles, 42 fixed tick timestamps, and integer landing offsets from 10–90% of the winning tile. The web implementation uses a compositor-driven rightward animation. It rebases the strip while preserving the exact visible cards and their positions, without a case overlay.

The 625:125:25:5:2 rarity weights reproduce the published standard weapon-case tier ratio. Items within a tier have equal probability. Filters remove unavailable tiers and renormalize the remaining weights. The winner is selected before animation; decorative cards never determine the result. Decorative neighbors avoid immediate repeats to reduce high-speed visual aliasing.

Rarity follows approximate VND price/person: blue ≤40k, purple ≤65k, pink ≤100k, red ≤130k, gold >130k.

This is a browser adaptation, not Valve's engine or backend. The case overlay is intentionally omitted. Food art, filtered pools and meal outcomes are intentionally different. Reduced-motion mode keeps timing but suppresses reel motion.
